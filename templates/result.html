                    <p>The X-ray findings are suggestive of COVID-19, showing bilateral ground-glass opacities and/or pulmonary infiltrates. However, these findings may overlap with other respiratory conditions. Clinical correlation and PCR testing are advised for a definitive diagnosis..</p>

                    <p>No abnormalities were detected in the X-ray image. However, please consult with a medical professional for a definitive diagnosis and further evaluation if symptoms persist.</p>

                    <p>The X-ray reveals consolidation and lobar infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. Further evaluation (e.g., sputum culture, clinical assessment) is recommended to identify the causative agent and guide treatment.</p>
                {% elif prediction == 'TURBERCULOSIS' %}
                    <p>The X-ray demonstrates cavitary lesions, hilar lymphadenopathy, or miliary patterns, which may indicate tuberculosis. Confirmatory testing (e.g., AFB smear, GeneXpert, or culture) and consultation with a specialist are strongly advised.</p>
